<h1>MRS. LIRRIPER&rsquo;S LEGACY</h1>
<h2>CHAPTER I&mdash;MRS. LIRRIPER RELATES HOW SHE WENT ON, AND WENT
OVER</h2>
<p>Ah!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s pleasant to drop into my own easy-chair my dear
though a little palpitating what with trotting up-stairs and what with
trotting down, and why kitchen stairs should all be corner stairs is
for the builders to justify though I do not think they fully understand
their trade and never did, else why the sameness and why not more conveniences
and fewer draughts and likewise making a practice of laying the plaster
on too thick I am well convinced which holds the damp, and as to chimney-pots
putting them on by guess-work like hats at a party and no more knowing
what their effect will be upon the smoke bless you than I do if so much,
except that it will mostly be either to send it down your throat in
a straight form or give it a twist before it goes there.&nbsp; And what
I says speaking as I find of those new metal chimneys all manner of
shapes (there&rsquo;s a row of &rsquo;em at Miss Wozenham&rsquo;s lodging-house
lower down on the other side of the way) is that they only work your
smoke into artificial patterns for you before you swallow it and that
I&rsquo;d quite as soon swallow mine plain, the flavour being the same,
not to mention the conceit of putting up signs on the top of your house
to show the forms in which you take your smoke into your inside.</p>
<p>Being here before your eyes my dear in my own easy-chair in my own
quiet room in my own Lodging-House Number Eighty-one Norfolk Street
Strand London situated midway between the City and St. James&rsquo;s&mdash;if
anything is where it used to be with these hotels calling themselves
Limited but called unlimited by Major Jackman rising up everywhere and
rising up into flagstaffs where they can&rsquo;t go any higher, but
my mind of those monsters is give me a landlord&rsquo;s or landlady&rsquo;s
wholesome face when I come off a journey and not a brass plate with
an electrified number clicking out of it which it&rsquo;s not in nature
can be glad to see me and to which I don&rsquo;t want to be hoisted
like molasses at the Docks and left there telegraphing for help with
the most ingenious instruments but quite in vain&mdash;being here my
dear I have no call to mention that I am still in the Lodgings as a
business hoping to die in the same and if agreeable to the clergy partly
read over at Saint Clement&rsquo;s Danes and concluded in Hatfield churchyard
when lying once again by my poor Lirriper ashes to ashes and dust to
dust.</p>
<p>Neither should I tell you any news my dear in telling you that the
Major is still a fixture in the Parlours quite as much so as the roof
of the house, and that Jemmy is of boys the best and brightest and has
ever had kept from him the cruel story of his poor pretty young mother
Mrs. Edson being deserted in the second floor and dying in my arms,
fully believing that I am his born Gran and him an orphan, though what
with engineering since he took a taste for it and him and the Major
making Locomotives out of parasols broken iron pots and cotton-reels
and them absolutely a getting off the line and falling over the table
and injuring the passengers almost equal to the originals it really
is quite wonderful.&nbsp; And when I says to the Major, &ldquo;Major
can&rsquo;t you by <i>any</i> means give us a communication with the
guard?&rdquo; the Major says quite huffy, &ldquo;No madam it&rsquo;s
not to be done,&rdquo; and when I says &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; the Major
says, &ldquo;That is between us who are in the Railway Interest madam
and our friend the Right Honourable Vice-President of the Board of Trade&rdquo;
and if you&rsquo;ll believe me my dear the Major wrote to Jemmy at school
to consult him on the answer I should have before I could get even that
amount of unsatisfactoriness out of the man, the reason being that when
we first began with the little model and the working signals beautiful
and perfect (being in general as wrong as the real) and when I says
laughing &ldquo;What appointment am I to hold in this undertaking gentlemen?&rdquo;
Jemmy hugs me round the neck and tells me dancing, &ldquo;You shall
be the Public Gran&rdquo; and consequently they put upon me just as
much as ever they like and I sit a growling in my easy-chair.</p>
<p>My dear whether it is that a grown man as clever as the Major cannot
give half his heart and mind to anything&mdash;even a plaything&mdash;but
must get into right down earnest with it, whether it is so or whether
it is not so I do not undertake to say, but Jemmy is far out-done by
the serious and believing ways of the Major in the management of the
United Grand Junction Lirriper and Jackman Great Norfolk Parlour Line,
&ldquo;For&rdquo; says my Jemmy with the sparkling eyes when it was
christened, &ldquo;we must have a whole mouthful of name Gran or our
dear old Public&rdquo; and there the young rogue kissed me, &ldquo;won&rsquo;t
stump up.&rdquo;&nbsp; So the Public took the shares&mdash;ten at ninepence,
and immediately when that was spent twelve Preference at one and sixpence&mdash;and
they were all signed by Jemmy and countersigned by the Major, and between
ourselves much better worth the money than some shares I have paid for
in my time.&nbsp; In the same holidays the line was made and worked
and opened and ran excursions and had collisions and burst its boilers
and all sorts of accidents and offences all most regular correct and
pretty.&nbsp; The sense of responsibility entertained by the Major as
a military style of station-master my dear starting the down train behind
time and ringing one of those little bells that you buy with the little
coal-scuttles off the tray round the man&rsquo;s neck in the street
did him honour, but noticing the Major of a night when he is writing
out his monthly report to Jemmy at school of the state of the Rolling
Stock and the Permanent Way and all the rest of it (the whole kept upon
the Major&rsquo;s sideboard and dusted with his own hands every morning
before varnishing his boots) I notice him as full of thought and care
as full can be and frowning in a fearful manner, but indeed the Major
does nothing by halves as witness his great delight in going out surveying
with Jemmy when he has Jemmy to go with, carrying a chain and a measuring-tape
and driving I don&rsquo;t know what improvements right through Westminster
Abbey and fully believed in the streets to be knocking everything upside
down by Act of Parliament.&nbsp; As please Heaven will come to pass
when Jemmy takes to that as a profession!</p>
<p>Mentioning my poor Lirriper brings into my head his own youngest
brother the Doctor though Doctor of what I am sure it would be hard
to say unless Liquor, for neither Physic nor Music nor yet Law does
Joshua Lirriper know a morsel of except continually being summoned to
the County Court and having orders made upon him which he runs away
from, and once was taken in the passage of this very house with an umbrella
up and the Major&rsquo;s hat on, giving his name with the door-mat round
him as Sir Johnson Jones, K.C.B. in spectacles residing at the Horse
Guards.&nbsp; On which occasion he had got into the house not a minute
before, through the girl letting him on the mat when he sent in a piece
of paper twisted more like one of those spills for lighting candles
than a note, offering me the choice between thirty shillings in hand
and his brains on the premises marked immediate and waiting for an answer.&nbsp;
My dear it gave me such a dreadful turn to think of the brains of my
poor dear Lirriper&rsquo;s own flesh and blood flying about the new
oilcloth however unworthy to be so assisted, that I went out of my room
here to ask him what he would take once for all not to do it for life
when I found him in the custody of two gentlemen that I should have
judged to be in the feather-bed trade if they had not announced the
law, so fluffy were their personal appearance.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bring your
chains, sir,&rdquo; says Joshua to the littlest of the two in the biggest
hat, &ldquo;rivet on my fetters!&rdquo;&nbsp; Imagine my feelings when
I pictered him clanking up Norfolk Street in irons and Miss Wozenham
looking out of window!&nbsp; &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; I says all of
a tremble and ready to drop &ldquo;please to bring him into Major Jackman&rsquo;s
apartments.&rdquo;&nbsp; So they brought him into the Parlours, and
when the Major spies his own curly-brimmed hat on him which Joshua Lirriper
had whipped off its peg in the passage for a military disguise he goes
into such a tearing passion that he tips it off his head with his hand
and kicks it up to the ceiling with his foot where it grazed long afterwards.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Major&rdquo; I says &ldquo;be cool and advise me what to do with
Joshua my dead and gone Lirriper&rsquo;s own youngest brother.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Madam&rdquo; says the Major &ldquo;my advice is that you board
and lodge him in a Powder Mill, with a handsome gratuity to the proprietor
when exploded.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Major&rdquo; I says &ldquo;as a Christian
you cannot mean your words.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Madam&rdquo; says the
Major &ldquo;by the Lord I do!&rdquo; and indeed the Major besides being
with all his merits a very passionate man for his size had a bad opinion
of Joshua on account of former troubles even unattended by liberties
taken with his apparel.&nbsp; When Joshua Lirriper hears this conversation
betwixt us he turns upon the littlest one with the biggest hat and says
&ldquo;Come sir!&nbsp; Remove me to my vile dungeon.&nbsp; Where is
my mouldy straw?&rdquo;&nbsp; My dear at the picter of him rising in
my mind dressed almost entirely in padlocks like Baron Trenck in Jemmy&rsquo;s
book I was so overcome that I burst into tears and I says to the Major,
&ldquo;Major take my keys and settle with these gentlemen or I shall
never know a happy minute more,&rdquo; which was done several times
both before and since, but still I must remember that Joshua Lirriper
has his good feelings and shows them in being always so troubled in
his mind when he cannot wear mourning for his brother.&nbsp; Many a
long year have I left off my widow&rsquo;s mourning not being wishful
to intrude, but the tender point in Joshua that I cannot help a little
yielding to is when he writes &ldquo;One single sovereign would enable
me to wear a decent suit of mourning for my much-loved brother.&nbsp;
I vowed at the time of his lamented death that I would ever wear sables
in memory of him but Alas how short-sighted is man, How keep that vow
when penniless!&rdquo;&nbsp; It says a good deal for the strength of
his feelings that he couldn&rsquo;t have been seven year old when my
poor Lirriper died and to have kept to it ever since is highly creditable.&nbsp;
But we know there&rsquo;s good in all of us,&mdash;if we only knew where
it was in some of us,&mdash;and though it was far from delicate in Joshua
to work upon the dear child&rsquo;s feelings when first sent to school
and write down into Lincolnshire for his pocket-money by return of post
and got it, still he is my poor Lirriper&rsquo;s own youngest brother
and mightn&rsquo;t have meant not paying his bill at the Salisbury Arms
when his affection took him down to stay a fortnight at Hatfield churchyard
and might have meant to keep sober but for bad company.&nbsp; Consequently
if the Major <i>had</i> played on him with the garden-engine which he
got privately into his room without my knowing of it, I think that much
as I should have regretted it there would have been words betwixt the
Major and me.&nbsp; Therefore my dear though he played on Mr. Buffle
by mistake being hot in his head, and though it might have been misrepresented
down at Wozenham&rsquo;s into not being ready for Mr. Buffle in other
respects he being the Assessed Taxes, still I do not so much regret
it as perhaps I ought.&nbsp; And whether Joshua Lirriper will yet do
well in life I cannot say, but I did hear of his coming, out at a Private
Theatre in the character of a Bandit without receiving any offers afterwards
from the regular managers.</p>
<p>Mentioning Mr. Baffle gives an instance of there being good in persons
where good is not expected, for it cannot be denied that Mr. Buffle&rsquo;s
manners when engaged in his business were not agreeable.&nbsp; To collect
is one thing, and to look about as if suspicious of the goods being
gradually removing in the dead of the night by a back door is another,
over taxing you have no control but suspecting is voluntary.&nbsp; Allowances
too must ever be made for a gentleman of the Major&rsquo;s warmth not
relishing being spoke to with a pen in the mouth, and while I do not
know that it is more irritable to my own feelings to have a low-crowned
hat with a broad brim kept on in doors than any other hat still I can
appreciate the Major&rsquo;s, besides which without bearing malice or
vengeance the Major is a man that scores up arrears as his habit always
was with Joshua Lirriper.&nbsp; So at last my dear the Major lay in
wait for Mr. Buffle, and it worrited me a good deal.&nbsp; Mr. Buffle
gives his rap of two sharp knocks one day and the Major bounces to the
door.&nbsp; &ldquo;Collector has called for two quarters&rsquo; Assessed
Taxes&rdquo; says Mr. Buffle.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are ready for him&rdquo;
says the Major and brings him in here.&nbsp; But on the way Mr. Buffle
looks about him in his usual suspicious manner and the Major fires and
asks him &ldquo;Do you see a Ghost sir?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No sir&rdquo;
says Mr. Buffle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Because I have before noticed you&rdquo;
says the Major &ldquo;apparently looking for a spectre very hard beneath
the roof of my respected friend.&nbsp; When you find that supernatural
agent, be so good as point him out sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Buffle stares
at the Major and then nods at me.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mrs. Lirriper sir&rdquo;
says the Major going off into a perfect steam and introducing me with
his hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;Pleasure of knowing her&rdquo; says Mr. Buffle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A&mdash;hum!&mdash;Jemmy Jackman sir!&rdquo; says the Major introducing
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;Honour of knowing you by sight&rdquo; says Mr.
Buffle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jemmy Jackman sir&rdquo; says the Major wagging
his head sideways in a sort of obstinate fury &ldquo;presents to you
his esteemed friend that lady Mrs. Emma Lirriper of Eighty-one Norfolk
Street Strand London in the County of Middlesex in the United Kingdom
of Great Britain and Ireland.&nbsp; Upon which occasion sir,&rdquo;
says the Major, &ldquo;Jemmy Jackman takes your hat off.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Mr. Buffle looks at his hat where the Major drops it on the floor, and
he picks it up and puts it on again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; says the
Major very red and looking him full in the face &ldquo;there are two
quarters of the Gallantry Taxes due and the Collector has called.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Upon which if you can believe my words my dear the Major drops Mr. Buffle&rsquo;s
hat off again.&nbsp; &ldquo;This&mdash;&rdquo; Mr. Buffle begins very
angry with his pen in his mouth, when the Major steaming more and more
says &ldquo;Take your bit out sir!&nbsp; Or by the whole infernal system
of Taxation of this country and every individual figure in the National
Debt, I&rsquo;ll get upon your back and ride you like a horse!&rdquo;
which it&rsquo;s my belief he would have done and even actually jerking
his neat little legs ready for a spring as it was.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo;
says Mr. Buffle without his pen &ldquo;is an assault and I&rsquo;ll
have the law of you.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Sir&rdquo; replies the Major
&ldquo;if you are a man of honour, your Collector of whatever may be
due on the Honourable Assessment by applying to Major Jackman at the
Parlours Mrs. Lirriper&rsquo;s Lodgings, may obtain what he wants in
full at any moment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Major glared at Mr. Buffle with those meaning words my dear
I literally gasped for a teaspoonful of salvolatile in a wine-glass
of water, and I says &ldquo;Pray let it go no farther gentlemen I beg
and beseech of you!&rdquo;&nbsp; But the Major could be got to do nothing
else but snort long after Mr. Buffle was gone, and the effect it had
upon my whole mass of blood when on the next day of Mr. Buffle&rsquo;s
rounds the Major spruced himself up and went humming a tune up and down
the street with one eye almost obliterated by his hat there are not
expressions in Johnson&rsquo;s Dictionary to state.&nbsp; But I safely
put the street door on the jar and got behind the Major&rsquo;s blinds
with my shawl on and my mind made up the moment I saw danger to rush
out screeching till my voice failed me and catch the Major round the
neck till my strength went and have all parties bound.&nbsp; I had not
been behind the blinds a quarter of an hour when I saw Mr. Buffle approaching
with his Collecting-books in his hand.&nbsp; The Major likewise saw
him approaching and hummed louder and himself approached.&nbsp; They
met before the Airy railings.&nbsp; The Major takes off his hat at arm&rsquo;s
length and says &ldquo;Mr. Buffle I believe?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr. Buffle
takes off <i>his</i> hat at arm&rsquo;s length and says &ldquo;That
is my name sir.&rdquo;&nbsp; Says the Major &ldquo;Have you any commands
for me, Mr. Buffle?&rdquo;&nbsp; Says Mr. Buffle &ldquo;Not any sir.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then my dear both of &rsquo;em bowed very low and haughty and parted,
and whenever Mr. Buffle made his rounds in future him and the Major
always met and bowed before the Airy railings, putting me much in mind
of Hamlet and the other gentleman in mourning before killing one another,
though I could have wished the other gentleman had done it fairer and
even if less polite no poison.</p>
<p>Mr. Buffle&rsquo;s family were not liked in this neighbourhood, for
when you are a householder my dear you&rsquo;ll find it does not come
by nature to like the Assessed, and it was considered besides that a
one-horse pheayton ought not to have elevated Mrs. Buffle to that height
especially when purloined from the Taxes which I myself did consider
uncharitable.&nbsp; But they were <i>not</i> liked and there was that
domestic unhappiness in the family in consequence of their both being
very hard with Miss Buffle and one another on account of Miss Buffle&rsquo;s
favouring Mr. Buffle&rsquo;s articled young gentleman, that it <i>was</i>
whispered that Miss Buffle would go either into a consumption or a convent
she being so very thin and off her appetite and two close-shaved gentlemen
with white bands round their necks peeping round the corner whenever
she went out in waistcoats resembling black pinafores.&nbsp; So things
stood towards Mr. Buffle when one night I was woke by a frightful noise
and a smell of burning, and going to my bedroom window saw the whole
street in a glow.&nbsp; Fortunately we had two sets empty just then
and before I could hurry on some clothes I heard the Major hammering
at the attics&rsquo; doors and calling out &ldquo;Dress yourselves!&mdash;Fire!&nbsp;
Don&rsquo;t be frightened!&mdash;Fire!&nbsp; Collect your presence of
mind!&mdash;Fire!&nbsp; All right&mdash;Fire!&rdquo; most tremenjously.&nbsp;
As I opened my bedroom door the Major came tumbling in over himself
and me, and caught me in his arms.&nbsp; &ldquo;Major&rdquo; I says
breathless &ldquo;where is it?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know
dearest madam&rdquo; says the Major&mdash;&ldquo;Fire!&nbsp; Jemmy Jackman
will defend you to the last drop of his blood&mdash;Fire!&nbsp; If the
dear boy was at home what a treat this would be for him&mdash;Fire!&rdquo;
and altogether very collected and bold except that he couldn&rsquo;t
say a single sentence without shaking me to the very centre with roaring
Fire.&nbsp; We ran down to the drawing-room and put our heads out of
window, and the Major calls to an unfeeling young monkey, scampering
by be joyful and ready to split &ldquo;Where is it?&mdash;Fire!&rdquo;&nbsp;
The monkey answers without stopping &ldquo;O here&rsquo;s a lark!&nbsp;
Old Buffle&rsquo;s been setting his house alight to prevent its being
found out that he boned the Taxes.&nbsp; Hurrah!&nbsp; Fire!&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then the sparks came flying up and the smoke came pouring down and
the crackling of flames and spatting of water and banging of engines
and hacking of axes and breaking of glass and knocking at doors and
the shouting and crying and hurrying and the heat and altogether gave
me a dreadful palpitation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened dearest
madam,&rdquo; says the Major, &ldquo;&mdash;Fire!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s
nothing to be alarmed at&mdash;Fire!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t open the street
door till I come back&mdash;Fire!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll go and see if I can
be of any service&mdash;Fire!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re quite composed and
comfortable ain&rsquo;t you?&mdash;Fire, Fire, Fire!&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was in vain for me to hold the man and tell him he&rsquo;d be galloped
to death by the engines&mdash;pumped to death by his over-exertions&mdash;wet-feeted
to death by the slop and mess&mdash;flattened to death when the roofs
fell in&mdash;his spirit was up and he went scampering off after the
young monkey with all the breath he had and none to spare, and me and
the girls huddled together at the parlour windows looking at the dreadful
flames above the houses over the way, Mr. Buffle&rsquo;s being round
the corner.&nbsp; Presently what should we see but some people running
down the street straight to our door, and then the Major directing operations
in the busiest way, and then some more people and then&mdash;carried
in a chair similar to Guy Fawkes&mdash;Mr. Buffle in a blanket!</p>
<p>My dear the Major has Mr. Buffle brought up our steps and whisked
into the parlour and carted out on the sofy, and then he and all the
rest of them without so much as a word burst away again full speed leaving
the impression of a vision except for Mr. Buffle awful in his blanket
with his eyes a rolling.&nbsp; In a twinkling they all burst back again
with Mrs. Buffle in another blanket, which whisked in and carted out
on the sofy they all burst off again and all burst back again with Miss
Buffle in another blanket, which again whisked in and carted out they
all burst off again and all burst back again with Mr. Buffle&rsquo;s
articled young gentleman in another blanket&mdash;him a holding round
the necks of two men carrying him by the legs, similar to the picter
of the disgraceful creetur who has lost the fight (but where the chair
I do not know) and his hair having the appearance of newly played upon.&nbsp;
When all four of a row, the Major rubs his hands and whispers me with
what little hoarseness he can get together, &ldquo;If our dear remarkable
boy was only at home what a delightful treat this would be for him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dear we made them some hot tea and toast and some hot brandy-and-water
with a little comfortable nutmeg in it, and at first they were scared
and low in their spirits but being fully insured got sociable.&nbsp;
And the first use Mr. Buffle made of his tongue was to call the Major
his Preserver and his best of friends and to say &ldquo;My for ever
dearest sir let me make you known to Mrs. Buffle&rdquo; which also addressed
him as her Preserver and her best of friends and was fully as cordial
as the blanket would admit of.&nbsp; Also Miss Buffle.&nbsp; The articled
young gentleman&rsquo;s head was a little light and he sat a moaning
&ldquo;Robina is reduced to cinders, Robina is reduced to cinders!&rdquo;&nbsp;
Which went more to the heart on account of his having got wrapped in
his blanket as if he was looking out of a violinceller case, until Mr.
Buffle says &ldquo;Robina speak to him!&rdquo;&nbsp; Miss Buffle says
&ldquo;Dear George!&rdquo; and but for the Major&rsquo;s pouring down
brandy-and-water on the instant which caused a catching in his throat
owing to the nutmeg and a violent fit of coughing it might have proved
too much for his strength.&nbsp; When the articled young gentleman got
the better of it Mr. Buffle leaned up against Mrs. Buffle being two
bundles, a little while in confidence, and then says with tears in his
eyes which the Major noticing wiped, &ldquo;We have not been an united
family, let us after this danger become so, take her George.&rdquo;&nbsp;
The young gentleman could not put his arm out far to do it, but his
spoken expressions were very beautiful though of a wandering class.&nbsp;
And I do not know that I ever had a much pleasanter meal than the breakfast
we took together after we had all dozed, when Miss Buffle made tea very
sweetly in quite the Roman style as depicted formerly at Covent Garden
Theatre and when the whole family was most agreeable, as they have ever
proved since that night when the Major stood at the foot of the Fire-Escape
and claimed them as they came down&mdash;the young gentleman head-foremost,
which accounts.&nbsp; And though I do not say that we should be less
liable to think ill of one another if strictly limited to blankets,
still I do say that we might most of us come to a better understanding
if we kept one another less at a distance.</p>
<p>Why there&rsquo;s Wozenham&rsquo;s lower down on the other side of
the street.&nbsp; I had a feeling of much soreness several years respecting
what I must still ever call Miss Wozenham&rsquo;s systematic underbidding
and the likeness of the house in Bradshaw having far too many windows
and a most umbrageous and outrageous Oak which never yet was seen in
Norfolk Street nor yet a carriage and four at Wozenham&rsquo;s door,
which it would have been far more to Bradshaw&rsquo;s credit to have
drawn a cab.&nbsp; This frame of mind continued bitter down to the very
afternoon in January last when one of my girls, Sally Rairyganoo which
I still suspect of Irish extraction though family represented Cambridge,
else why abscond with a bricklayer of the Limerick persuasion and be
married in pattens not waiting till his black eye was decently got round
with all the company fourteen in number and one horse fighting outside
on the roof of the vehicle,&mdash;I repeat my dear my ill-regulated
state of mind towards Miss Wozenham continued down to the very afternoon
of January last past when Sally Rairyganoo came banging (I can use no
milder expression) into my room with a jump which may be Cambridge and
may not, and said &ldquo;Hurroo Missis!&nbsp; Miss Wozenham&rsquo;s
sold up!&rdquo;&nbsp; My dear when I had it thrown in my face and conscience
that the girl Sally had reason to think I could be glad of the ruin
of a fellow-creeter, I burst into tears and dropped back in my chair
and I says &ldquo;I am ashamed of myself!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Well!&nbsp; I tried to settle to my tea but I could not do it what
with thinking of Miss Wozenham and her distresses.&nbsp; It was a wretched
night and I went up to a front window and looked over at Wozenham&rsquo;s
and as well as I could make it out down the street in the fog it was
the dismallest of the dismal and not a light to be seen.&nbsp; So at
last I save to myself &ldquo;This will not do,&rdquo; and I puts on
my oldest bonnet and shawl not wishing Miss Wozenham to be reminded
of my best at such a time, and lo and behold you I goes over to Wozenham&rsquo;s
and knocks.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Wozenham at home?&rdquo; I says turning
my head when I heard the door go.&nbsp; And then I saw it was Miss Wozenham
herself who had opened it and sadly worn she was poor thing and her
eyes all swelled and swelled with crying.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss Wozenham&rdquo;
I says &ldquo;it is several years since there was a little unpleasantness
betwixt us on the subject of my grandson&rsquo;s cap being down your
Airy.&nbsp; I have overlooked it and I hope you have done the same.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes Mrs. Lirriper&rdquo; she says in a surprise, &ldquo;I have.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then my dear&rdquo; I says &ldquo;I should be glad to come in
and speak a word to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; Upon my calling her my dear Miss
Wozenham breaks out a crying most pitiful, and a not unfeeling elderly
person that might have been better shaved in a nightcap with a hat over
it offering a polite apology for the mumps having worked themselves
into his constitution, and also for sending home to his wife on the
bellows which was in his hand as a writing-desk, looks out of the back
parlour and says &ldquo;The lady wants a word of comfort&rdquo; and
goes in again.&nbsp; So I was able to say quite natural &ldquo;Wants
a word of comfort does she sir?&nbsp; Then please the pigs she shall
have it!&rdquo;&nbsp; And Miss Wozenham and me we go into the front
room with a wretched light that seemed to have been crying too and was
sputtering out, and I says &ldquo;Now my dear, tell me all,&rdquo; and
she wrings her hands and says &ldquo;O Mrs. Lirriper that man is in
possession here, and I have not a friend in the world who is able to
help me with a shilling.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t signify a bit what a talkative old body like me
said to Miss Wozenham when she said that, and so I&rsquo;ll tell you
instead my dear that I&rsquo;d have given thirty shillings to have taken
her over to tea, only I durstn&rsquo;t on account of the Major.&nbsp;
Not you see but what I knew I could draw the Major out like thread and
wind him round my finger on most subjects and perhaps even on that if
I was to set myself to it, but him and me had so often belied Miss Wozenham
to one another that I was shamefaced, and I knew she had offended his
pride and never mine, and likewise I felt timid that that Rairyganoo
girl might make things awkward.&nbsp; So I says &ldquo;My dear if you
could give me a cup of tea to clear my muddle of a head I should better
understand your affairs.&rdquo;&nbsp; And we had the tea and the affairs
too and after all it was but forty pound, and&mdash;There! she&rsquo;s
as industrious and straight a creeter as ever lived and has paid back
half of it already, and where&rsquo;s the use of saying more, particularly
when it ain&rsquo;t the point?&nbsp; For the point is that when she
was a kissing my hands and holding them in hers and kissing them again
and blessing blessing blessing, I cheered up at last and I says &ldquo;Why
what a waddling old goose I have been my dear to take you for something
so very different!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah but I too&rdquo; says she
&ldquo;how have <i>I</i> mistaken <i>you</i>!&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Come
for goodness&rsquo; sake tell me&rdquo; I says &ldquo;what you thought
of me?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O&rdquo; says she &ldquo;I thought you had
no feeling for such a hard hand-to-mouth life as mine, and were rolling
in affluence.&rdquo;&nbsp; I says shaking my sides (and very glad to
do it for I had been a choking quite long enough) &ldquo;Only look at
my figure my dear and give me your opinion whether if I was in affluence
I should be likely to roll in it?&rdquo;&nbsp; That did it?&nbsp; We
got as merry as grigs (whatever <i>they</i> are, if you happen to know
my dear&mdash;<i>I</i> don&rsquo;t) and I went home to my blessed home
as happy and as thankful as could be.&nbsp; But before I make an end
of it, think even of my having misunderstood the Major!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp;
For next forenoon the Major came into my little room with his brushed
hat in his hand and he begins &ldquo;My dearest madam&mdash;&rdquo;
and then put his face in his hat as if he had just come into church.&nbsp;
As I sat all in a maze he came out of his hat and began again.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My esteemed and beloved friend&mdash;&rdquo; and then went into
his hat again.&nbsp; &ldquo;Major,&rdquo; I cries out frightened &ldquo;has
anything happened to our darling boy?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, no, no&rdquo;
says the Major &ldquo;but Miss Wozenham has been here this morning to
make her excuses to me, and by the Lord I can&rsquo;t get over what
she told me.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Hoity toity, Major,&rdquo; I says &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t know yet that I was afraid of you last night and didn&rsquo;t
think half as well of you as I ought!&nbsp; So come out of church Major
and forgive me like a dear old friend and I&rsquo;ll never do so any
more.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I leave you to judge my dear whether I ever did
or will.&nbsp; And how affecting to think of Miss Wozenham out of her
small income and her losses doing so much for her poor old father, and
keeping a brother that had had the misfortune to soften his brain against
the hard mathematics as neat as a new pin in the three back represented
to lodgers as a lumber-room and consuming a whole shoulder of mutton
whenever provided!</p>
<p>And now my dear I really am a going to tell you about my Legacy if
you&rsquo;re inclined to favour me with your attention, and I did fully
intend to have come straight to it only one thing does so bring up another.&nbsp;
It was the month of June and the day before Midsummer Day when my girl
Winifred Madgers&mdash;she was what is termed a Plymouth Sister, and
the Plymouth Brother that made away with her was quite right, for a
tidier young woman for a wife never came into a house and afterwards
called with the beautifullest Plymouth Twins&mdash;it was the day before
Midsummer Day when Winifred Madgers comes and says to me &ldquo;A gentleman
from the Consul&rsquo;s wishes particular to speak to Mrs. Lirriper.&rdquo;&nbsp;
If you&rsquo;ll believe me my dear the Consols at the bank where I have
a little matter for Jemmy got into my head, and I says &ldquo;Good gracious
I hope he ain&rsquo;t had any dreadful fall!&rdquo;&nbsp; Says Winifred
&ldquo;He don&rsquo;t look as if he had ma&rsquo;am.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
I says &ldquo;Show him in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman came in dark and with his hair cropped what I should
consider too close, and he says very polite &ldquo;Madame Lirrwiper!&rdquo;&nbsp;
I says, &ldquo;Yes sir.&nbsp; Take a chair.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;I come,&rdquo;
says he &ldquo;frrwom the Frrwench Consul&rsquo;s.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I
saw at once that it wasn&rsquo;t the Bank of England.&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;We
have rrweceived,&rdquo; says the gentleman turning his r&rsquo;s very
curious and skilful, &ldquo;frrwom the Mairrwie at Sens, a communication
which I will have the honour to rrwead.&nbsp; Madame Lirrwiper understands
Frrwench?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;O dear no sir!&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Madame
Lirriper don&rsquo;t understand anything of the sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;It
matters not,&rdquo; says the gentleman, &ldquo;I will trrwanslate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that my dear the gentleman after reading something about a Department
and a Marie (which Lord forgive me I supposed till the Major came home
was Mary, and never was I more puzzled than to think how that young
woman came to have so much to do with it) translated a lot with the
most obliging pains, and it came to this:&mdash;That in the town of
Sons in France an unknown Englishman lay a dying.&nbsp; That he was
speechless and without motion.&nbsp; That in his lodging there was a
gold watch and a purse containing such and such money and a trunk containing
such and such clothes, but no passport and no papers, except that on
his table was a pack of cards and that he had written in pencil on the
back of the ace of hearts: &ldquo;To the authorities.&nbsp; When I am
dead, pray send what is left, as a last Legacy, to Mrs. Lirriper Eighty-one
Norfolk Street Strand London.&rdquo;&nbsp; When the gentleman had explained
all this, which seemed to be drawn up much more methodical than I should
have given the French credit for, not at that time knowing the nation,
he put the document into my hand.&nbsp; And much the wiser I was for
that you may be sure, except that it had the look of being made out
upon grocery paper and was stamped all over with eagles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does Madame Lirrwiper&rdquo; says the gentleman &ldquo;believe
she rrwecognises her unfortunate compatrrwiot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>You may imagine the flurry it put me into my dear to be talked to
about my compatriots.</p>
<p>I says &ldquo;Excuse me.&nbsp; Would you have the kindness sir to
make your language as simple as you can?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Englishman unhappy, at the point of death.&nbsp; This
compatrrwiot afflicted,&rdquo; says the gentleman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you sir&rdquo; I says &ldquo;I understand you now.&nbsp;
No sir I have not the least idea who this can be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Madame Lirrwiper no son, no nephew, no godson, no frrwiend,
no acquaintance of any kind in Frrwance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To my certain knowledge&rdquo; says I &ldquo;no relation or
friend, and to the best of my belief no acquaintance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me.&nbsp; You take Locataires?&rdquo; says the gentleman.</p>
<p>My dear fully believing he was offering me something with his obliging
foreign manners,&mdash;snuff for anything I knew,&mdash;I gave a little
bend of my head and I says if you&rsquo;ll credit it, &ldquo;No I thank
you.&nbsp; I have not contracted the habit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gentleman looks perplexed and says &ldquo;Lodgers!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; says I laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bless the man!&nbsp;
Why yes to be sure!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;May it not be a former lodger?&rdquo; says the gentleman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Some lodger that you pardoned some rrwent?&nbsp; You have pardoned
lodgers some rrwent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hem!&nbsp; It has happened sir&rdquo; says I, &ldquo;but I
assure you I can call to mind no gentleman of that description that
this is at all likely to be.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In short my dear, we could make nothing of it, and the gentleman
noted down what I said and went away.&nbsp; But he left me the paper
of which he had two with him, and when the Major came in I says to the
Major as I put it in his hand &ldquo;Major here&rsquo;s Old Moore&rsquo;s
Almanac with the hieroglyphic complete, for your opinion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took the Major a little longer to read than I should have thought,
judging from the copious flow with which he seemed to be gifted when
attacking the organ-men, but at last he got through it, and stood a
gazing at me in amazement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Major&rdquo; I says &ldquo;you&rsquo;re paralysed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam&rdquo; says the Major, &ldquo;Jemmy Jackman is doubled
up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now it did so happen that the Major had been out to get a little
information about railroads and steamboats, as our boy was coming home
for his Midsummer holidays next day and we were going to take him somewhere
for a treat and a change.&nbsp; So while the Major stood a gazing it
came into my head to say to him &ldquo;Major I wish you&rsquo;d go and
look at some of your books and maps, and see whereabouts this same town
of Sens is in France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major he roused himself and he went into the Parlours and he
poked about a little, and he came back to me and he says, &ldquo;Sens
my dearest madam is seventy-odd miles south of Paris.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With what I may truly call a desperate effort &ldquo;Major,&rdquo;
I says &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go there with our blessed boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If ever the Major was beside himself it was at the thoughts of that
journey.&nbsp; All day long he was like the wild man of the woods after
meeting with an advertisement in the papers telling him something to
his advantage, and early next morning hours before Jemmy could possibly
come home he was outside in the street ready to call out to him that
we was all a going to France.&nbsp; Young Rosycheeks you may believe
was as wild as the Major, and they did carry on to that degree that
I says &ldquo;If you two children ain&rsquo;t more orderly I&rsquo;ll
pack you both off to bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then they fell to cleaning
up the Major&rsquo;s telescope to see France with, and went out and
bought a leather bag with a snap to hang round Jemmy, and him to carry
the money like a little Fortunatus with his purse.</p>
<p>If I hadn&rsquo;t passed my word and raised their hopes, I doubt
if I could have gone through with the undertaking but it was too late
to go back now.&nbsp; So on the second day after Midsummer Day we went
off by the morning mail.&nbsp; And when we came to the sea which I had
never seen but once in my life and that when my poor Lirriper was courting
me, the freshness of it and the deepness and the airiness and to think
that it had been rolling ever since and that it was always a rolling
and so few of us minding, made me feel quite serious.&nbsp; But I felt
happy too and so did Jemmy and the Major and not much motion on the
whole, though me with a swimming in the head and a sinking but able
to take notice that the foreign insides appear to be constructed hollower
than the English, leading to much more tremenjous noises when bad sailors.</p>
<p>But my dear the blueness and the lightness and the coloured look
of everything and the very sentry-boxes striped and the shining rattling
drums and the little soldiers with their waists and tidy gaiters, when
we got across to the Continent&mdash;it made me feel as if I don&rsquo;t
know what&mdash;as if the atmosphere had been lifted off me.&nbsp; And
as to lunch why bless you if I kept a man-cook and two kitchen-maids
I couldn&rsquo;t got it done for twice the money, and no injured young
woman a glaring at you and grudging you and acknowledging your patronage
by wishing that your food might choke you, but so civil and so hot and
attentive and every way comfortable except Jemmy pouring wine down his
throat by tumblers-full and me expecting to see him drop under the table.</p>
<p>And the way in which Jemmy spoke his French was a real charm.&nbsp;
It was often wanted of him, for whenever anybody spoke a syllable to
me I says &ldquo;Non-comprenny, you&rsquo;re very kind, but it&rsquo;s
no use&mdash;Now Jemmy!&rdquo; and then Jemmy he fires away at &rsquo;em
lovely, the only thing wanting in Jemmy&rsquo;s French being as it appeared
to me that he hardly ever understood a word of what they said to him
which made it scarcely of the use it might have been though in other
respects a perfect Native, and regarding the Major&rsquo;s fluency I
should have been of the opinion judging French by English that there
might have been a greater choice of words in the language though still
I must admit that if I hadn&rsquo;t known him when he asked a military
gentleman in a gray cloak what o&rsquo;clock it was I should have took
him for a Frenchman born.</p>
<p>Before going on to look after my Legacy we were to make one regular
day in Paris, and I leave you to judge my dear what a day <i>that</i>
was with Jemmy and the Major and the telescope and me and the prowling
young man at the inn door (but very civil too) that went along with
us to show the sights.&nbsp; All along the railway to Paris Jemmy and
the Major had been frightening me to death by stooping down on the platforms
at stations to inspect the engines underneath their mechanical stomachs,
and by creeping in and out I don&rsquo;t know where all, to find improvements
for the United Grand Junction Parlour, but when we got out into the
brilliant streets on a bright morning they gave up all their London
improvements as a bad job and gave their minds to Paris.&nbsp; Says
the prowling young man to me &ldquo;Will I speak Inglis No?&rdquo;&nbsp;
So I says &ldquo;If you can young man I shall take it as a favour,&rdquo;
but after half-an-hour of it when I fully believed the man had gone
mad and me too I says &ldquo;Be so good as fall back on your French
sir,&rdquo; knowing that then I shouldn&rsquo;t have the agonies of
trying to understand him, which was a happy release.&nbsp; Not that
I lost much more than the rest either, for I generally noticed that
when he had described something very long indeed and I says to Jemmy
&ldquo;What does he say Jemmy?&rdquo;&nbsp; Jemmy says looking with
vengeance in his eye &ldquo;He is so jolly indistinct!&rdquo; and that
when he had described it longer all over again and I says to Jemmy &ldquo;Well
Jemmy what&rsquo;s it all about?&rdquo; Jemmy says &ldquo;He says the
building was repaired in seventeen hundred and four, Gran.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wherever that prowling young man formed his prowling habits I cannot
be expected to know, but the way in which he went round the corner while
we had our breakfasts and was there again when we swallowed the last
crumb was most marvellous, and just the same at dinner and at night,
prowling equally at the theatre and the inn gateway and the shop doors
when we bought a trifle or two and everywhere else but troubled with
a tendency to spit.&nbsp; And of Paris I can tell you no more my dear
than that it&rsquo;s town and country both in one, and carved stone
and long streets of high houses and gardens and fountains and statues
and trees and gold, and immensely big soldiers and immensely little
soldiers and the pleasantest nurses with the whitest caps a playing
at skipping-rope with the bunchiest babies in the flattest caps, and
clean table-cloths spread everywhere for dinner and people sitting out
of doors smoking and sipping all day long and little plays being acted
in the open air for little people and every shop a complete and elegant
room, and everybody seeming to play at everything in this world.&nbsp;
And as to the sparkling lights my dear after dark, glittering high up
and low down and on before and on behind and all round, and the crowd
of theatres and the crowd of people and the crowd of all sorts, it&rsquo;s
pure enchantment.&nbsp; And pretty well the only thing that grated on
me was that whether you pay your fare at the railway or whether you
change your money at a money-dealer&rsquo;s or whether you take your
ticket at the theatre, the lady or gentleman is caged up (I suppose
by government) behind the strongest iron bars having more of a Zoological
appearance than a free country.</p>
<p>Well to be sure when I did after all get my precious bones to bed
that night, and my Young Rogue came in to kiss me and asks &ldquo;What
do you think of this lovely lovely Paris, Gran?&rdquo;&nbsp; I says
&ldquo;Jemmy I feel as if it was beautiful fireworks being let off in
my head.&rdquo;&nbsp; And very cool and refreshing the pleasant country
was next day when we went on to look after my Legacy, and rested me
much and did me a deal of good.</p>
<p>So at length and at last my dear we come to Sens, a pretty little
town with a great two-towered cathedral and the rooks flying in and
out of the loopholes and another tower atop of one of the towers like
a sort of a stone pulpit.&nbsp; In which pulpit with the birds skimming
below him if you&rsquo;ll believe me, I saw a speck while I was resting
at the inn before dinner which they made signs to me was Jemmy and which
really was.&nbsp; I had been a fancying as I sat in the balcony of the
hotel that an Angel might light there and call down to the people to
be good, but I little thought what Jemmy all unknown to himself was
a calling down from that high place to some one in the town.</p>
<p>The pleasantest-situated inn my dear!&nbsp; Right under the two towers,
with their shadows a changing upon it all day like a kind of a sundial,
and country people driving in and out of the courtyard in carts and
hooded cabriolets and such like, and a market outside in front of the
cathedral, and all so quaint and like a picter.&nbsp; The Major and
me agreed that whatever came of my Legacy this was the place to stay
in for our holiday, and we also agreed that our dear boy had best not
be checked in his joy that night by the sight of the Englishman if he
was still alive, but that we would go together and alone.&nbsp; For
you are to understand that the Major not feeling himself quite equal
in his wind to the height to which Jemmy had climbed, had come back
to me and left him with the Guide.</p>
<p>So after dinner when Jemmy had set off to see the river, the Major
went down to the Mairie, and presently came back with a military character
in a sword and spurs and a cocked hat and a yellow shoulder-belt and
long tags about him that he must have found inconvenient.&nbsp; And
the Major says &ldquo;The Englishman still lies in the same state dearest
madam.&nbsp; This gentleman will conduct us to his lodging.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Upon which the military character pulled off his cocked hat to me, and
I took notice that he had shaved his forehead in imitation of Napoleon
Bonaparte but not like.</p>
<p>We wont out at the courtyard gate and past the great doors of the
cathedral and down a narrow High Street where the people were sitting
chatting at their shop doors and the children were at play.&nbsp; The
military character went in front and he stopped at a pork-shop with
a little statue of a pig sitting up, in the window, and a private door
that a donkey was looking out of.</p>
<p>When the donkey saw the military character he came slipping out on
the pavement to turn round and then clattered along the passage into
a back yard.&nbsp; So the coast being clear, the Major and me were conducted
up the common stair and into the front room on the second, a bare room
with a red tiled floor and the outside lattice blinds pulled close to
darken it.&nbsp; As the military character opened the blinds I saw the
tower where I had seen Jemmy, darkening as the sun got low, and I turned
to the bed by the wall and saw the Englishman.</p>
<p>It was some kind of brain fever he had had, and his hair was all
gone, and some wetted folded linen lay upon his head.&nbsp; I looked
at him very attentive as he lay there all wasted away with his eyes
closed, and I says to the Major&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>I</i> never saw this face before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major looked at him very attentive too, and he says &ldquo;I
never saw this face before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When the Major explained our words to the military character, that
gentleman shrugged his shoulders and showed the Major the card on which
it was written about the Legacy for me.&nbsp; It had been written with
a weak and trembling hand in bed, and I knew no more of the writing
than of the face.&nbsp; Neither did the Major.</p>
<p>Though lying there alone, the poor creetur was as well taken care
of as could be hoped, and would have been quite unconscious of any one&rsquo;s
sitting by him then.&nbsp; I got the Major to say that we were not going
away at present and that I would come back to-morrow and watch a bit
by the bedside.&nbsp; But I got him to add&mdash;and I shook my head
hard to make it stronger&mdash;&ldquo;We agree that we never saw this
face before.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our boy was greatly surprised when we told him sitting out in the
balcony in the starlight, and he ran over some of those stories of former
Lodgers, of the Major&rsquo;s putting down, and asked wasn&rsquo;t it
possible that it might be this lodger or that lodger.&nbsp; It was not
possible, and we went to bed.</p>
<p>In the morning just at breakfast-time the military character came
jingling round, and said that the doctor thought from the signs he saw
there might be some rally before the end.&nbsp; So I says to the Major
and Jemmy, &ldquo;You two boys go and enjoy yourselves, and I&rsquo;ll
take my Prayer Book and go sit by the bed.&rdquo;&nbsp; So I went, and
I sat there some hours, reading a prayer for him poor soul now and then,
and it was quite on in the day when he moved his hand.</p>
<p>He had been so still, that the moment he moved I knew of it, and
I pulled off my spectacles and laid down my book and rose and looked
at him.&nbsp; From moving one hand he began to move both, and then his
action was the action of a person groping in the dark.&nbsp; Long after
his eyes had opened, there was a film over them and he still felt for
his way out into light.&nbsp; But by slow degrees his sight cleared
and his hands stopped.&nbsp; He saw the ceiling, he saw the wall, he
saw me.&nbsp; As his sight cleared, mine cleared too, and when at last
we looked in one another&rsquo;s faces, I started back, and I cries
passionately:</p>
<p>&ldquo;O you wicked wicked man!&nbsp; Your sin has found you out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>For I knew him, the moment life looked out of his eyes, to be Mr.
Edson, Jemmy&rsquo;s father who had so cruelly deserted Jemmy&rsquo;s
young unmarried mother who had died in my arms, poor tender creetur,
and left Jemmy to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cruel wicked man!&nbsp; You bad black traitor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>With the little strength he had, he made an attempt to turn over
on his wretched face to hide it.&nbsp; His arm dropped out of the bed
and his head with it, and there he lay before me crushed in body and
in mind.&nbsp; Surely the miserablest sight under the summer sun!</p>
<p>&ldquo;O blessed Heaven,&rdquo; I says a crying, &ldquo;teach me
what to say to this broken mortal!&nbsp; I am a poor sinful creetur,
and the Judgment is not mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I lifted my eyes up to the clear bright sky, I saw the high tower
where Jemmy had stood above the birds, seeing that very window; and
the last look of that poor pretty young mother when her soul brightened
and got free, seemed to shine down from it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O man, man, man!&rdquo; I says, and I went on my knees beside
the bed; &ldquo;if your heart is rent asunder and you are truly penitent
for what you did, Our Saviour will have mercy on you yet!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I leaned my face against the bed, his feeble hand could just move
itself enough to touch me.&nbsp; I hope the touch was penitent.&nbsp;
It tried to hold my dress and keep hold, but the fingers were too weak
to close.</p>
<p>I lifted him back upon the pillows and I says to him:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you hear me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked yes, even yet more plainly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not here alone.&nbsp; The Major is with me.&nbsp; You
recollect the Major?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.&nbsp; That is to say he made out yes, in the same way as before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And even the Major and I are not alone.&nbsp; My grandson&mdash;his
godson&mdash;is with us.&nbsp; Do you hear?&nbsp; My grandson.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The fingers made another trial to catch my sleeve, but could only
creep near it and fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know who my grandson is?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I pitied and loved his lonely mother.&nbsp; When his mother
lay a dying I said to her, &lsquo;My dear, this baby is sent to a childless
old woman.&rsquo;&nbsp; He has been my pride and joy ever since.&nbsp;
I love him as dearly as if he had drunk from my breast.&nbsp; Do you
ask to see my grandson before you die?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Show me, when I leave off speaking, if you correctly understand
what I say.&nbsp; He has been kept unacquainted with the story of his
birth.&nbsp; He has no knowledge of it.&nbsp; No suspicion of it.&nbsp;
If I bring him here to the side of this bed, he will suppose you to
be a perfect stranger.&nbsp; It is more than I can do to keep from him
the knowledge that there is such wrong and misery in the world; but
that it was ever so near him in his innocent cradle I have kept from
him, and I do keep from him, and I ever will keep from him, for his
mother&rsquo;s sake, and for his own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He showed me that he distinctly understood, and the tears fell from
his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now rest, and you shall see him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So I got him a little wine and some brandy, and I put things straight
about his bed.&nbsp; But I began to be troubled in my mind lest Jemmy
and the Major might be too long of coming back.&nbsp; What with this
occupation for my thoughts and hands, I didn&rsquo;t hear a foot upon
the stairs, and was startled when I saw the Major stopped short in the
middle of the room by the eyes of the man upon the bed, and knowing
him then, as I had known him a little while ago.</p>
<p>There was anger in the Major&rsquo;s face, and there was horror and
repugnance and I don&rsquo;t know what.&nbsp; So I went up to him and
I led him to the bedside, and when I clasped my hands and lifted of
them up, the Major did the like.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Lord&rdquo; I says &ldquo;Thou knowest what we two saw together
of the sufferings and sorrows of that young creetur now with Thee.&nbsp;
If this dying man is truly penitent, we two together humbly pray Thee
to have mercy on him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Major says &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; and then after a little stop I
whispers him, &ldquo;Dear old friend fetch our beloved boy.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And the Major, so clever as to have got to understand it all without
being told a word, went away and brought him.</p>
<p>Never never never shall I forget the fair bright face of our boy
when he stood at the foot of the bed, looking at his unknown father.&nbsp;
And O so like his dear young mother then!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jemmy&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;I have found out all about this
poor gentleman who is so ill, and he did lodge in the old house once.&nbsp;
And as he wants to see all belonging to it, now that he is passing away,
I sent for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah poor man!&rdquo; says Jemmy stepping forward and touching
one of his hands with great gentleness.&nbsp; &ldquo;My heart melts
for him.&nbsp; Poor, poor man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The eyes that were so soon to close for ever turned to me, and I
was not that strong in the pride of my strength that I could resist
them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My darling boy, there is a reason in the secret history of
this fellow-creetur lying as the best and worst of us must all lie one
day, which I think would ease his spirit in his last hour if you would
lay your cheek against his forehead and say, &lsquo;May God forgive
you!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;O Gran,&rdquo; says Jemmy with a full heart, &ldquo;I am not
worthy!&rdquo;&nbsp; But he leaned down and did it.&nbsp; Then the faltering
fingers made out to catch hold of my sleeve at last, and I believe he
was a-trying to kiss me when he died.</p>
<p>* * * * *</p>
<p>There my dear!&nbsp; There you have the story of my Legacy in full,
and it&rsquo;s worth ten times the trouble I have spent upon it if you
are pleased to like it.</p>
<p>You might suppose that it set us against the little French town of
Sens, but no we didn&rsquo;t find that.&nbsp; I found myself that I
never looked up at the high tower atop of the other tower, but the days
came back again when that fair young creetur with her pretty bright
hair trusted in me like a mother, and the recollection made the place
so peaceful to me as I can&rsquo;t express.&nbsp; And every soul about
the hotel down to the pigeons in the courtyard made friends with Jemmy
and the Major, and went lumbering away with them on all sorts of expeditions
in all sorts of vehicles drawn by rampagious cart-horses,&mdash;with
heads and without,&mdash;mud for paint and ropes for harness,&mdash;and
every new friend dressed in blue like a butcher, and every new horse
standing on his hind legs wanting to devour and consume every other
horse, and every man that had a whip to crack crack-crack-crack-crack-cracking
it as if it was a schoolboy with his first.&nbsp; As to the Major my
dear that man lived the greater part of his time with a little tumbler
in one hand and a bottle of small wine in the other, and whenever he
saw anybody else with a little tumbler, no matter who it was,&mdash;the
military character with the tags, or the inn-servants at their supper
in the courtyard, or townspeople a chatting on a bench, or country people
a starting home after market,&mdash;down rushes the Major to clink his
glass against their glasses and cry,&mdash;Hola!&nbsp; Vive Somebody!
or Vive Something! as if he was beside himself.&nbsp; And though I could
not quite approve of the Major&rsquo;s doing it, still the ways of the
world are the ways of the world varying according to the different parts
of it, and dancing at all in the open Square with a lady that kept a
barber&rsquo;s shop my opinion is that the Major was right to dance
his best and to lead off with a power that I did not think was in him,
though I was a little uneasy at the Barricading sound of the cries that
were set up by the other dancers and the rest of the company, until
when I says &ldquo;What are they ever calling out Jemmy?&rdquo; Jemmy
says, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re calling out Gran, Bravo the Military English!&nbsp;
Bravo the Military English!&rdquo; which was very gratifying to my feelings
as a Briton and became the name the Major was known by.</p>
<p>But every evening at a regular time we all three sat out in the balcony
of the hotel at the end of the courtyard, looking up at the golden and
rosy light as it changed on the great towers, and looking at the shadows
of the towers as they changed on all about us ourselves included, and
what do you think we did there?&nbsp; My dear, if Jemmy hadn&rsquo;t
brought some other of those stories of the Major&rsquo;s taking down
from the telling of former lodgers at Eighty-one Norfolk Street, and
if he didn&rsquo;t bring &rsquo;em out with this speech:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here you are Gran!&nbsp; Here you are godfather!&nbsp; More
of &rsquo;em!&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll read.&nbsp; And though you wrote &rsquo;em
for me, godfather, I know you won&rsquo;t disapprove of my making &rsquo;em
over to Gran; will you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, my dear boy,&rdquo; says the Major.&nbsp; &ldquo;Everything
we have is hers, and we are hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hers ever affectionately and devotedly J. Jackman, and J.
Jackman Lirriper,&rdquo; cries the Young Rogue giving me a close hug.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Very well then godfather.&nbsp; Look here.&nbsp; As Gran is in
the Legacy way just now, I shall make these stories a part of Gran&rsquo;s
Legacy.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll leave &rsquo;em to her.&nbsp; What do you say
godfather?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hip hip Hurrah!&rdquo; says the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well then,&rdquo; cries Jemmy all in a bustle.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Vive the Military English!&nbsp; Vive the Lady Lirriper!&nbsp;
Vive the Jemmy Jackman Ditto!&nbsp; Vive the Legacy!&nbsp; Now, you
look out, Gran.&nbsp; And you look out, godfather.&nbsp; <i>I&rsquo;ll</i>
read!&nbsp; And I&rsquo;ll tell you what I&rsquo;ll do besides.&nbsp;
On the last night of our holiday here when we are all packed and going
away, I&rsquo;ll top up with something of my own.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mind you do sir&rdquo; says I.</p>
<h2>CHAPTER II&mdash;MRS. LIRRIPER RELATES HOW JEMMY TOPPED UP</h2>
<p>Well my dear and so the evening readings of those jottings of the
Major&rsquo;s brought us round at last to the evening when we were all
packed and going away next day, and I do assure you that by that time
though it was deliciously comfortable to look forward to the dear old
house in Norfolk Street again, I had formed quite a high opinion of
the French nation and had noticed them to be much more homely and domestic
in their families and far more simple and amiable in their lives than
I had ever been led to expect, and it did strike me between ourselves
that in one particular they might be imitated to advantage by another
nation which I will not mention, and that is in the courage with which
they take their little enjoyments on little means and with little things
and don&rsquo;t let solemn big-wigs stare them out of countenance or
speechify them dull, of which said solemn big-wigs I have ever had the
one opinion that I wish they were all made comfortable separately in
coppers with the lids on and never let out any more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now young man,&rdquo; I says to Jemmy when we brought our
chairs into the balcony that last evening, &ldquo;you please to remember
who was to &lsquo;top up.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right Gran&rdquo; says Jemmy.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am the illustrious
personage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But he looked so serious after he had made me that light answer,
that the Major raised his eyebrows at me and I raised mine at the Major.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gran and godfather,&rdquo; says Jemmy, &ldquo;you can hardly
think how much my mind has run on Mr. Edson&rsquo;s death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It gave me a little check.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah! it was a sad scene my
love&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;and sad remembrances come back stronger than
merry.&nbsp; But this&rdquo; I says after a little silence, to rouse
myself and the Major and Jemmy all together, &ldquo;is not topping up.&nbsp;
Tell us your story my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will&rdquo; says Jemmy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the date sir?&rdquo; says I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once upon
a time when pigs drank wine?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No Gran,&rdquo; says Jemmy, still serious; &ldquo;once upon
a time when the French drank wine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again I glanced at the Major, and the Major glanced at me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short, Gran and godfather,&rdquo; says Jemmy, looking up,
&ldquo;the date is this time, and I&rsquo;m going to tell you Mr. Edson&rsquo;s
story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flutter that it threw me into.&nbsp; The change of colour on
the part of the Major!</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is to say, you understand,&rdquo; our bright-eyed boy
says, &ldquo;I am going to give you my version of it.&nbsp; I shall
not ask whether it&rsquo;s right or not, firstly because you said you
knew very little about it, Gran, and secondly because what little you
did know was a secret.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I folded my hands in my lap and I never took my eyes off Jemmy as
he went running on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The unfortunate gentleman&rdquo; Jemmy commences, &ldquo;who
is the subject of our present narrative was the son of Somebody, and
was born Somewhere, and chose a profession Somehow.&nbsp; It is not
with those parts of his career that we have to deal; but with his early
attachment to a young and beautiful lady.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I thought I should have dropped.&nbsp; I durstn&rsquo;t look at the
Major; but I know what his state was, without looking at him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The father of our ill-starred hero&rdquo; says Jemmy, copying
as it seemed to me the style of some of his story-books, &ldquo;was
a worldly man who entertained ambitious views for his only son and who
firmly set his face against the contemplated alliance with a virtuous
but penniless orphan.&nbsp; Indeed he went so far as roundly to assure
our hero that unless he weaned his thoughts from the object of his devoted
affection, he would disinherit him.&nbsp; At the same time, he proposed
as a suitable match the daughter of a neighbouring gentleman of a good
estate, who was neither ill-favoured nor unamiable, and whose eligibility
in a pecuniary point of view could not be disputed.&nbsp; But young
Mr. Edson, true to the first and only love that had inflamed his breast,
rejected all considerations of self-advancement, and, deprecating his
father&rsquo;s anger in a respectful letter, ran away with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My dear I had begun to take a turn for the better, but when it come
to running away I began to take another turn for the worse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The lovers&rdquo; says Jemmy &ldquo;fled to London and were
united at the altar of Saint Clement&rsquo;s Danes.&nbsp; And it is
at this period of their simple but touching story that we find them
inmates of the dwelling of a highly-respected and beloved lady of the
name of Gran, residing within a hundred miles of Norfolk Street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I felt that we were almost safe now, I felt that the dear boy had
no suspicion of the bitter truth, and I looked at the Major for the
first time and drew a long breath.&nbsp; The Major gave me a nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our hero&rsquo;s father&rdquo; Jemmy goes on &ldquo;proving
implacable and carrying his threat into unrelenting execution, the struggles
of the young couple in London were severe, and would have been far more
so, but for their good angel&rsquo;s having conducted them to the abode
of Mrs. Gran; who, divining their poverty (in spite of their endeavours
to conceal it from her), by a thousand delicate arts smoothed their
rough way, and alleviated the sharpness of their first distress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here Jemmy took one of my hands in one of his, and began a marking
the turns of his story by making me give a beat from time to time upon
his other hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After a while, they left the house of Mrs. Gran, and pursued
their fortunes through a variety of successes and failures elsewhere.&nbsp;
But in all reverses, whether for good or evil, the words of Mr. Edson
to the fair young partner of his life were, &lsquo;Unchanging Love and
Truth will carry us through all!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>My hand trembled in the dear boy&rsquo;s, those words were so wofully
unlike the fact.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unchanging Love and Truth&rdquo; says Jemmy over again, as
if he had a proud kind of a noble pleasure in it, &ldquo;will carry
us through all!&nbsp; Those were his words.&nbsp; And so they fought
their way, poor but gallant and happy, until Mrs. Edson gave birth to
a child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A daughter,&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; says Jemmy, &ldquo;a son.&nbsp; And the father
was so proud of it that he could hardly bear it out of his sight.&nbsp;
But a dark cloud overspread the scene.&nbsp; Mrs. Edson sickened, drooped,
and died.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&nbsp; Sickened, drooped, and died!&rdquo; I says.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so Mr. Edson&rsquo;s only comfort, only hope on earth,
and only stimulus to action, was his darling boy.&nbsp; As the child
grew older, he grew so like his mother that he was her living picture.&nbsp;
It used to make him wonder why his father cried when he kissed him.&nbsp;
But unhappily he was like his mother in constitution as well as in face,
and lo, died too before he had grown out of childhood.&nbsp; Then Mr.
Edson, who had good abilities, in his forlornness and despair, threw
them all to the winds.&nbsp; He became apathetic, reckless, lost.&nbsp;
Little by little he sank down, down, down, down, until at last he almost
lived (I think) by gaming.&nbsp; And so sickness overtook him in the
town of Sens in France, and he lay down to die.&nbsp; But now that he
laid him down when all was done, and looked back upon the green Past
beyond the time when he had covered it with ashes, he thought gratefully
of the good Mrs. Gran long lost sight of, who had been so kind to him
and his young wife in the early days of their marriage, and he left
the little that he had as a last Legacy to her.&nbsp; And she, being
brought to see him, at first no more knew him than she would know from
seeing the ruin of a Greek or Roman Temple, what it used to be before
it fell; but at length she remembered him.&nbsp; And then he told her,
with tears, of his regret for the misspent part of his life, and besought
her to think as mildly of it as she could, because it was the poor fallen
Angel of his unchanging Love and Constancy after all.&nbsp; And because
she had her grandson with her, and he fancied that his own boy, if he
had lived, might have grown to be something like him, he asked her to
let him touch his forehead with his cheek and say certain parting words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jemmy&rsquo;s voice sank low when it got to that, and tears filled
my eyes, and filled the Major&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You little Conjurer&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;how did you ever
make it all out?&nbsp; Go in and write it every word down, for it&rsquo;s
a wonder.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Which Jemmy did, and I have repeated it to you my dear from his writing.</p>
<p>Then the Major took my hand and kissed it, and said, &ldquo;Dearest
madam all has prospered with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah Major&rdquo; I says drying my eyes, &ldquo;we needn&rsquo;t
have been afraid.&nbsp; We might have known it.&nbsp; Treachery don&rsquo;t
come natural to beaming youth; but trust and pity, love and constancy,&mdash;they
do, thank God!&rdquo;</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
